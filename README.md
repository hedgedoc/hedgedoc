CodiMD lets you create real-time collaborative markdown notes. You can test-drive
it by visiting our [CodiMD demo server][codimd-demo].

It is inspired by Hackpad, Etherpad and similar collaborative editors. This
project originated with the team at [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) and now forked
into its own organisation. [A longer writeup can be read in the history doc](docs/history.md).

## Installation / Upgrading

You can run CodiMD in a number of ways, and we created setup instructions for
all of these:

* [Docker](docs/setup/docker.md)
* [Kubernetes](docs/setup/kubernetes.md)
* [Cloudron](docs/setup/cloudron.md)
* [Heroku](docs/setup/heroku.md)
* [manual setup](docs/setup/manual-setup.md)

If you do not wish to run your own setup, you can find a commercial offering at
https://hackmd.io. This is not the same codebase as this one, but it is a very
similar project.


## Configuration

Theres two main ways to configure your CodiMD instance:
[Config file](docs/configuration-config-file.md) or
[environment variables](docs/configuration-env-vars.md). You can choose what
works best for you.

CodiMD can integrate with

* facebook, twitter, github, gitlab, mattermost, dropbox, google, ldap, saml and [oauth2](docs/guides/auth/oauth.md) **for login**
* imgur, s3, minio, azure **for image/attachment storage** (files can also be local!)
* dropbox **for export and import**

More info about that can be found in the configuration docs above.
