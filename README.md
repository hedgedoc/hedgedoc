# CodiMD - React Client

This is the new, improved and better looking frontend for CodiMD 2.0.
Our goal is to recreate the current frontend in react and to improve it.

## Development mode


1. Clone this repo
2. run `yarn install`
3. run `yarn start`

This should run the app in the development mode and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Production mode

1. Clone this repo
2. run `yarn install`
3. run `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
