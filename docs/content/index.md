HedgeDoc lets you create real-time collaborative markdown notes. You can test-drive
it by visiting our [HedgeDoc demo server][hedgedoc-demo].

It is inspired by Hackpad, Etherpad and similar collaborative editors. This
project originated with the team at [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) and now forked
into its own organization. [A longer write-up can be read in the history doc][hedgedoc-history-details] or [you can have a look at an explanatory graph over at our website][hedgedoc-history].

If you have any questions that aren't answered here, feel free to ask us on [Matrix][matrix.org-url], stop by our [community forums][hedgedoc-community] or have a look at our [FAQ][hedgedoc-faq].
