# Slide Separators

If you're getting started with reveal.js slides, there are a few things you need to know.

There are two types of slides, those that transition horizontally and those that transition vertically (subslides).

The following separators are used for each in the HedgeDoc syntax:

```markdown
# First Slide

---

# Next slide

----

## Subslide
```
as you can see, horizontal transitions are separated by `---` and vertical transitions by `----`

## Basic YAML header
It's possible to customise the slide options using the YAML header in the slide markdown.

eg:
```yaml
---
title: Example Slide
tags: presentation
slideOptions:
  theme: solarized
  transition: 'fade'
  # parallaxBackgroundImage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg'
---
```
make sure to have two spaces only at the start of the listed slide options.

you can comment out options with a `#`
