# API documentation
Several tasks of HedgeDoc can be automated through HTTP requests.
The available endpoints for this api are described in this document.
For code-autogeneration there is an OpenAPIv3-compatible description available [here](openapi.yml).

## Notes
These endpoints create notes, return information about them or export them.  
You have to replace *\<NOTE\>* with either the alias or id of a note you want to work on.
