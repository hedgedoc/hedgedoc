# Authentication guide - GitHub

*Note:* This guide was written before the renaming. Just replace `HackMD` with `HedgeDoc` in your mind :smile: thanks!

1. Sign-in or sign-up for a GitHub account

2. Navigate to developer settings in your GitHub account [here](https://github.com/settings/developers) and select the "OAuth Apps" tab

3. Click on the **New OAuth App** button, to create a new OAuth App:  
   ![create-oauth-app](../../images/auth/create-oauth-app.png)

4. Fill out the new OAuth application registration form, and click **Register Application**  
   ![register-oauth-application-form](../../images/auth/register-oauth-application-form.png)

   **Note:** *The callback URL is <your-hedgedoc-url>/auth/github/callback*

5. After successfully registering the application, you'll receive the Client ID and Client Secret for the application  
   ![application-page](../../images/auth/application-page.png)

6. Add the Client ID and Client Secret to your config.json file or pass them as environment variables
  - `config.json`:
    ```js
    {
      "production": {
        "github": {
          "clientID": "3747d30eaccXXXXXXXXX",
          "clientSecret": "2a8e682948eee0c580XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  - environment variables:
    ```sh
    CMD_GITHUB_CLIENTID=3747d30eaccXXXXXXXXX
    CMD_GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET=2a8e682948eee0c580XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ````
