# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Deprecations
- This version of HedgeDoc is the last version, that supports the following short code syntax for embedding content. The
  new way to embed this external content is to put the plain link into a single line of the document.
    - `{%youtube someid %}` -> https://youtube.com/watch?v=someid
    - `{%vimeo 123456789 %}` -> https://vimeo.com/123456789
    - `{%gist user/12345 %}` -> https://gist.github.com/user/12345
    - `{%slideshare user/my-awesome-presentation %}` -> Embedding removed
    - `{%speakerdeck foobar %}` -> Embedding removed
    - `{%pdf https://example.org/example-pdf.pdf %}` -> Embedding removed
- The use of `sequence` as code block language ([Why?](https://github.com/hedgedoc/react-client/issues/488#issuecomment-683262875))
- Comma-separated definition of tags in the yaml-frontmatter

### Removed

- SlideShare embedding
    - If a legacy embedding code is detected, then it will show the link to the presentation instead of the embedded
      presentation.
- Speakerdeck embedding
    - If a legacy embedding code is detected, then it will show the link to the presentation instead of the embedded
      presentation.
- PDF embedding (See [#959](https://github.com/hedgedoc/react-client/issues/959))
    - If a legacy embedding code is detected, then it will show the link to the pdf instead.
- We are now using `highlight.js` instead of `highlight.js` + `prism.js` for code highlighting. Check out
  the [highlight.js demo page](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/) to see which languages are supported. The
  highlighting for following languages isn't supported by `highlight.js`:
    - tiddlywiki
    - mediawiki
    - jsx
- Alternative anchor URL formats
- Import HTML and convert to Markdown
- Import content from a url
- F9 shortcut to sort lines
- Highlight.JS language support for `1c` was removed.
- Support for tag definitions in headings

- The code button now adds code fences even if the user selected nothing beforehand
- Code blocks with 'csv' as language render as tables.
- All images can be clicked to show them in full screen.
- Code blocks have a 'Copy code to clipboard' button.
- Code blocks with 'vega-lite' as language are rendered as [vega-lite diagrams](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/).
- Markdown files can be imported into an existing note directly from the editor.
- The table button in the toolbar opens an overlay where the user can choose the number of columns and rows.
- A toggle in the editor preferences for turning ligatures on and off.

- Image tags with placeholder urls (`https://`) will be replaced with a placeholder frame.
- Images that are currently uploading will be rendered as "uploading".
- Code blocks with `plantuml` as language are rendered as [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) diagram using a configured render server.
- File based motd that supports markdown without html.
- New notes can be created with a pre-given content when accessing `/new?content=Example%20content`.

### Changed

- The history shows both the entries saved in LocalStorage and the entries saved on the server together
- The gist embedding uses a click-shield, like vimeo and youtube
- HTML-Iframes are capsuled in click-shields
- Use [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) as icon font
- The `[name=...]`, `[time=...]` and `[color=...]` tags may now be used anywhere in the document and not just inside of blockquotes and lists.
- The <i class="fa fa-picture-o"/> (add image) and <i class="fa fa-link"/> (add link) toolbar buttons put selected links directly in the `()` instead of the `[]` part of the generated markdown.
- The help dialog has multiple tabs, and is a bit more organized.
- Use KaTeX instead of MathJax. ([Why?](https://github.com/hedgedoc/react-client/issues/495))
- The dark-mode is also applied to the read-only-view and can be toggled from there.
